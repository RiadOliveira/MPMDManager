<h2 id="proposal">üí° Proposal</h2>
<p>
  MPMDManager, as the name suggests, is a software tool that provides a manager for MPMD environments, simplifying the identification and connection procedures between parallel programs. The project introduces two distinct abstractions:
</p>

- **Single World**: Designed for cases where parallel programs are executed in MPI's MPMD mode, meaning all programs are launched with a single command line, separated by colons (:). In this context, all program processes share the same *MPI_COMM_WORLD*, which is why this abstraction is called *Single World*.
- **Multi World**: Intended for cases where parallel programs are executed independently, each with its own command line. In this scenario, each program has its own *MPI_COMM_WORLD* that encompasses only its own processes, hence the name *Multi World*. Communication in this abstraction is achieved using MPI's client/server methods, which require the execution of an intermediary server via the *ompi-server* command.

<p>
The abstractions are available in C, using the original MPI library, and in Python, through the <i>mpi4py</i> package. Both versions retain the functionality and capabilities of the <i>Single World</i> and <i>Multi World</i> abstractions, offering suitable alternatives for different needs and levels of expertise.

<h2 id="reference">:blue_book: API Reference</h2>

<p>
This section provides a comprehensive overview of all functions offered by the abstractions, detailing their names, syntax, and descriptions. The documentation includes both <i>Single World</i> and <i>Multi World</i> abstractions, with the latter featuring a clear distinction between Client and Server functionalities. All functions are documented for both supported languages, C and Python, ensuring compatibility and clarity for developers across diverse platforms.

In C, the functionalities are implemented as standalone functions with specific naming conventions for clarity. For <i>Single World</i>, all functions are prefixed with ```Manager_```. For <i>Multi World</i>, functions are categorized into Client and Server, using the prefixes ```Client_``` and ```Server_```, respectively.

In Python, the approach differs slightly by using distinct classes to encapsulate the functionality. The ```MPMDManager``` class represents the <i>Single World</i> abstraction, while the <i>Multi World</i> abstraction is divided into two separate classes: ```ClientManager``` and ```ServerManager```. Each class employs static methods defined with the ```@staticmethod``` decorator, allowing the functions to be called directly from the class without requiring object instantiation.

<h3 id="reference-single">Single World</h3>

- **Init**:
  - Description: Initializes the manager by setting its communicator and connections. This routine performs communication among all processes, so it must be called by all of them at the start of their execution, immediately after ```MPI_Init()```.
  - Syntax:
    - C: ```const MPMDManager* Manager_Init(char** argv)```
    - Python: ```MPMDManager.init() -> None```
  - Note: In C, the function returns a pointer to the ```Manager```, which is required by other functions.
- **Finalize**:
  - Description: Finalizes the manager, freeing all allocated resources and terminating established connections.
  - Syntax:
    - C: ```void Manager_Finalize(const MPMDManager* manager)```
    - Python: ```MPMDManager.finalize() -> None```
- **Local Name**:
  - Description: Returns the name of the local program.

  - Description: Returns the communicator of the local program.
  - Syntax:
    - C: ```const MPI_Comm* Manager_Local_comm(const MPMDManager* manager)```
    - Python: ```MPMDManager.local_comm() -> MPI.Intracomm```
- **Local Rank**:
  - Description: Returns the rank of the process within the context of the local program.

  - Description: Returns the size of a remote program identified by the provided ID, which can be its name or index.
  - Syntax:
    - C: ```unsigned int Manager_Size_of(const MPMDManager* manager, ConnectionId id, IdType idType)```
    - Python: ```MPMDManager.size_of(identifier: str | int) -> int```

  - Syntax:
    - C: ```const ClientManager* Client_Init(uint maxServers)```
    - Python: ```ClientManager.init() -> None```
