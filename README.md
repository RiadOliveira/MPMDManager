<h2 id="proposal">üí° Proposal</h2>
<p>
  MPMDManager, as the name suggests, is a software tool that provides a manager for MPMD environments, simplifying the identification and connection procedures between parallel programs. The project introduces two distinct abstractions:
</p>

- **Single World**: Designed for cases where parallel programs are executed in MPI's MPMD mode, meaning all programs are launched with a single command line, separated by colons (:). In this context, all program processes share the same *MPI_COMM_WORLD*, which is why this abstraction is called *Single World*.
- **Multi World**: Intended for cases where parallel programs are executed independently, each with its own command line. In this scenario, each program has its own *MPI_COMM_WORLD* that encompasses only its own processes, hence the name *Multi World*. Communication in this abstraction is achieved using MPI's client/server methods, which require the execution of an intermediary server via the *ompi-server* command.

<p>
The abstractions are available in C, using the original MPI library, and in Python, through the <i>mpi4py</i> package. Both versions retain the functionality and capabilities of the <i>Single World</i> and <i>Multi World</i> abstractions, offering suitable alternatives for different needs and levels of expertise.
